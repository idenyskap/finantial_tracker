## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- PostgreSQL 15 (or use Docker Compose)
- Maven 3.6 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/idenyskap/finantial_tracker.git
   cd finantial_tracker
   ```

2. Start PostgreSQL database
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Configure application properties

   The application uses `application-dev.yml` for local development. Update database and email settings as needed:
   ```yaml
   spring:
     datasource:
       url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres
       username: postgres
       password: postgres
     mail:
       host: localhost
       port: 1025
   ```

4. Build and run the backend
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

5. Install and run the frontend
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Access the application
